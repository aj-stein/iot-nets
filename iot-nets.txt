      A summary of security-enabling technologies for IoT devices
                        draft-moran-iot-nets-02

Abstract

   The IETF has developed security technologies that help to secure the
   Internet of Things even over constrained networks and when targetting
   constrained nodes.  These technologies can be used independenly or
   can be composed into larger systems to mitigate a variety of threats.
   This documents illustrates an overview over these technologies and
   highlights their relationships.  Ultimately, a threat model is
   presented as a basis to derive requirements that interconnect
   existing and emerging solution technologies.

1.  Introduction

   This memo serves as an entry-point to detail which technologies are
   available for use in IoT networks and to enable IoT designers to
   discover technologies that may solve their problems.  This draft
   addresses.

   Many baseline security requirements documents have been drafted by
   standards setting organisations, however these documents typically do
   not specify the technologies available to satisfy those requirements.
   They also do not express the next steps if an implementor wants to go
   above and beyond the baseline in order to differentiate their
   products and enable even better security.  This memo defines the
   mapping from some IoT baseline security requirements definitions to
   ietf and related security technologies.  It also highlights some gaps
   in those IoT baseline security requirements.

2.  Survey of baseline security requirements

   At time of writing, there are IoT baseline security requirements
   provided by several organisations:

   *  ENISA's Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT in the context
      of Critical Information Infrastructures ([ENISA-Baseline])

   *  ETSI's Cyber Security for Consumer Internet of Things: Baseline
      Requirements [ETSI-Baseline]

   *  NIST's IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline
      [NIST-Baseline]

3.  Requirement Mapping

   Requirements that pertain to hardware, procedure, and policy
   compliance are noted, but do not map to ietf and related
   technologies.

3.1.  Hardware Security

3.1.1.  Hardware Immutable Root of Trust

   ENISA GP-TM-01: Employ a hardware-based immutable root of trust.

   This is an architectural requirement.



Moran                     Expires 24 April 2023                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


3.1.2.  Hardware-Backed Secret Storage

   ENISA GP-TM-02: Use hardware that incorporates security features to
   strengthen the protection and integrity of the device - for example,
   specialised security chips / coprocessors that integrate security at
   the transistor level, embedded in the processor, providing, among
   other things, a trusted storage of device identity and authentication
   means, protection of keys at rest and in use, and preventing
   unprivileged from accessing to security sensitive code.  Protection
   against local and physical attacks can be covered via functional
   security.

   This is an architectural requirement.

3.2.  Software Integrity & Authenticity

3.2.1.  Boot Environment Trustworthiness and Integrity

   ENISA GP-TM-03: Trust must be established in the boot environment
   before any trust in any other software or executable program can be
   claimed.

   Satisfying this requirement can be done in several ways, increasing
   in security guarantees:

   1.  Implement secure boot to verify the bootloader and boot
       environment.  Trust is established purely by construction: if
       code is running in the boot environment, it must have been
       signed, therefore it is trustworthy.

   2.  Record critical measurements of each step of boot in a TPM.
       Trust is established by evaluating the measurements recorded by
       the TPM.

   3.  Use Remote Attestation.  Remote attestation allows a device to
       report to third parties the critical measurements it has recorded
       (either in a TPM or signed by each stage) in order to prove the
       trustworthiness of the boot environment and running software.
       Remote Attestation is implemented in [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].

3.2.2.  Code Integrity and Authenticity

   ENISA GP-TM-04: Sign code cryptographically to ensure it has not been
   tampered with after signing it as safe for the device, and implement
   run-time protection and secure execution monitoring to make sure
   malicious attacks do not overwrite code after it is loaded.

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


   Satisfying this requirement requires a secure invocation mechanism.
   In monolithic IoT software images, this is accomplished by Secure
   Boot.  In IoT devices with more fully-featured operating systems,
   this is accomplished with an operating system-specific code signing
   practice.

   Secure Invocation can be achieved using the SUIT Manifest format,
   which provides for secure invocation procedures.  See
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest].

   To satisfy the associated requirement of run-time protection and
   secure execution monitoring, the use of a TEE is recommended to
   protect sensitive processes.  The TEEP protocol (see
   [I-D.ietf-teep-architecture]) is recommended for managing TEEs.

3.2.3.  Secure Firmware Update

   ENISA GP-TM-05: Control the installation of software in operating
   systems, to prevent unauthenticated software and files from being
   loaded onto it.

   Many fully-featured operating systems have dedicated means of
   implementing this requirement.  The SUIT manifest (See
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]) is recommended as a means of providing
   secure, authenticated software update.  Where the software is
   deployed to a TEE, TEEP (See [I-D.ietf-teep-protocol]) is recommended
   for software update and management.

3.2.4.  Resilience to Failure

   ENISA GP-TM-06: Enable a system to return to a state that was known
   to be secure, after a security breach has occured or if an upgrade
   has not been successful.

   While there is no specificaiton for this, it is also required in
   [RFC9019]

3.2.5.  Trust Anchor Management

   ENISA GP-TM-07: Use protocols and mechanisms able to represent and
   manage trust and trust relationships.

   EST (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030) and LwM2M
   Bootstrap ([LwM2M]) provide a mechanism to replace trust anchors
   (manage trust/trust relationships).

3.3.  Default Security & Privacy

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


3.3.1.  Security ON by Default

   ENISA GP-TM-08: Any applicable security features should be enabled by
   default, and any unused or insecure functionalities should be
   disabled by default.

   This is a procedural requirement, rather than a protocol or document
   requirement.

3.3.2.  Default Unique Passwords

   ENISA GP-TM-09: Establish hard to crack, device-individual default
   passwords.

   This is a procedural requirement, rather than a protocol or document
   requirement.

3.4.  Data Protection

   The data protection requirements are largely procedural/
   architectural.  While this memo can recommend using TEEs to protect
   data, and TEEP ([I-D.ietf-teep-architecture]) to manage TEEs,
   implementors must choose to architect their software in such a way
   that TEEs are helpful in meeting these requirements.

   ENISA Data Protection requirements:

   *  GP-TM-10: Personal data must be collected and processed fairly and
      lawfully, it should never be collected and processed without the
      data subject's consent.

   *  GP-TM-11: Make sure that personal data is used for the specified
      purposes for which they were collected, and that any further
      processing of personal data is compatible and that the data
      subjects are well informed.

   *  GP-TM-12: Minimise the data collected and retained.

   *  GP-TM-13: IoT stakeholders must be compliant with the EU General
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

   *  GP-TM-14: Users of IoT products and services must be able to
      exercise their rights to information, access, erasure,
      rectification, data portability, restriction of processing,
      objection to processing, and their right not to be evaluated on
      the basis of automated processing.

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


3.5.  System Safety and Reliability

   Safety and reliability requirements are procedural/architectural.
   Implementors should ensure they have processes and architectures in
   place to meet these requirements.

   ENISA Safety and Reliability requirements:

   *  GP-TM-15: Design with system and operational disruption in mind,
      preventing the system from causing an unacceptable risk of injury
      or physical damage.

   *  GP-TM-16: Mechanisms for self-diagnosis and self-repair/healing to
      recover from failure, malfunction or a compromised state.

   *  GP-TM-17: Ensure standalone operation - essential features should
      continue to work with a loss of communications and chronicle
      negative impacts from compromised devices or cloud-based systems.

3.6.  Secure Software / Firmware updates

   Technical requirements for Software Updates are provided for in SUIT
   ([I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]) and TEEP ([I-D.ietf-teep-protocol]).
   Procedural and architectural requirements should be independently
   assessed by the implementor.

   ENISA Software Update Requirements:

   *  GP-TM-18: Ensure that the device software/firmware, its
      configuration and its applications have the ability to update
      Over-The-Air (OTA), that the update server is secure, that the
      update file is transmitted via a secure connection, that it does
      not contain sensitive data (e.g. hardcoded credentials), that it
      is signed by an authorised trust entity and encrypted using
      accepted encryption methods, and that the update package has its
      digital signature, signing certificate and signing certificate
      chain, verified by the device before the update process begins.

   *  GP-TM-19: Offer an automatic firmware update mechanism.

   *  GP-TM-20: (Procedural / Architectural) Backward compatibility of
      firmware updates.  Automatic firmware updates should not modify
      user-configured preferences, security, and/or privacy settings
      without user notification.

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


3.7.  Authentication

3.7.1.  Align Authentication Schemes with Threat Models

   ENISA GP-TM-21: Design the authentication and authorisation schemes
   (unique per device) based on the system-level threat models.

   This is a procedural / architectural requirement.

3.7.2.  Password Rules

   ENISA applies the following requirements to Password-based
   authentication:

   *  GP-TM-22: Ensure that default passwords and even default usernames
      are changed during the initial setup, and that weak, null or blank
      passwords are not allowed.

   *  GP-TM-23: Authentication mechanisms must use strong passwords or
      personal identification numbers (PINs), and should consider using
      two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) like Smartphones, Biometrics, etc., on top of certificates.

   *  GP-TM-24: Authentication credentials shall be salted, hashed and/
      or encrypted.

   *  GP-TM-25: Protect against 'brute force' and/or other abusive login
      attempts.  This protection should also consider keys stored in
      devices.

   *  GP-TM-26: Ensure password recovery or reset mechanism is robust
      and does not supply an attacker with information indicating a
      valid account.  The same applies to key update and recovery
      mechanisms.

   As an alternative, implementors are encouraged to consider
   passwordless schemes, such as FIDO.

3.8.  Authorisation

3.8.1.  Principle of Least Privilege

   ENISA GP-TM-27: Limit the actions allowed for a given system by
   Implementing fine-grained authorisation mechanisms and using the
   Principle of least privilege (POLP): applications must operate at the
   lowest privilege level possible.





Moran                     Expires 24 April 2023                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


   This is a procedural / architectural requirement, however at the
   network level, this can be implemented using Manufacturer Usage
   Descriptions (see [RFC8520]).

3.8.2.  Software Isolation

   ENISA GP-TM-28: Device firmware should be designed to isolate
   privileged code, processes and data from portions of the firmware
   that do not need access to them.  Device hardware should provide
   isolation concepts to prevent unprivileged from accessing security
   sensitive code.

   Implementors should use TEEs to address this requirement.  The
   provisioning and management of TEEs can be accomplished using TEEP
   (see [I-D.ietf-teep-architecture]).

3.8.3.  Access Control

   ENISA GP-TM-29: Data integrity and confidentiality must be enforced
   by access controls.  When the subject requesting access has been
   authorised to access particular processes, it is necessary to enforce
   the defined security policy.  ENISA GP-TM-30: Ensure a context-based
   security and privacy that reflects different levels of importance.

   These requirements are complex and require a variety of technologies
   to implement.  Use of TEEs can provide a building block for these
   requirements, but is not sufficient in itself to meet these
   requiremnents.

3.9.  Environmental and Physical Security

   ENISA defines the following physical security requirements.  These
   are hardware-architectural requirements and not covered by protocol
   and format specifications.

   *  GP-TM-31: Measures for tamper protection and detection.  Detection
      and reaction to hardware tampering should not rely on network
      connectivity.

   *  GP-TM-32: Ensure that the device cannot be easily disassembled and
      that the data storage medium is encrypted at rest and cannot be
      easily removed.

   *  GP-TM-33: Ensure that devices only feature the essential physical
      external ports (such as USB) necessary for them to function and
      that the test/debug modes are secure, so they cannot be used to
      maliciously access the devices.  In general, lock down physical
      ports to only trusted connections.

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


3.10.  Cryptography

   ENISA makes the following architectural cryptography requirements for
   IoT devices:

   *  GP-TM-34: Ensure a proper and effective use of cryptography to
      protect the confidentiality, authenticity and/or integrity of data
      and information (including control messages), in transit and in
      rest.  Ensure the proper selection of standard and strong
      encryption algorithms and strong keys, and disable insecure
      protocols.  Verify the robustness of the implementation.

   *  GP-TM-35: Cryptographic keys must be securely managed.

   *  GP-TM-36: Build devices to be compatible with lightweight
      encryption and security techniques.

   *  GP-TM-37: Support scalable key management schemes.

3.11.  Secure and Trusted Communications

3.11.1.  Data Security

   GP-TM-38: Guarantee the different security aspects -confidentiality
   (privacy), integrity, availability and authenticity- of the
   information in transit on the networks or stored in the IoT
   application or in the Cloud.

   This Data Security requirement can be fulfilled using COSE [RFC8152]
   for ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data
   either in transit or at rest.  Secure Transport (see Section 3.11.2)
   technologies can be used to protect data in transit.

3.11.2.  Secure Transport

   ENISA GP-TM-39: Ensure that communication security is provided using
   state-of-the-art, standardised security protocols, such as TLS for
   encryption.  ENISA GP-TM-40: Ensure credentials are not exposed in
   internal or external network traffic.

   This requirement is satisfied by several standards:

   *  TLS ([RFC8446]).

   *  DTLS ([RFC9147]).

   *  QUIC ([RFC9000]).

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


   *  OSCORE ([RFC9203]).

3.11.3.  Data Authenticity

   ENISA GP-TM-41: Guarantee data authenticity to enable reliable
   exchanges from data emission to data reception.  Data should always
   be signed whenever and wherever it is captured and stored.

   The authenticity of data can be protected using COSE [RFC8152].

   ENISA GP-TM-42: Do not trust data received and always verify any
   interconnections.  Discover, identify and verify/authenticate the
   devices connected to the network before trust can be established, and
   preserve their integrity for reliable solutions and services.

   Verifying communication partners can be done in many ways.  Key
   technologies supporting authentication of communication partners are:

   *  RATS: Remote attestation of a communication partner (See
      [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]).

   *  TLS/DTLS: Mutual authentication of communication partners (See
      [RFC8446] / [RFC9147]).

   *  ATLS: Application-layer TLS for authenticating a connection that
      may traverse multiple secure transport connections.

   *  Attested TLS: The use of attestation in session establishment in
      TLS (See [I-D.fossati-tls-attestation]).

3.11.4.  Least Privilege Communication

   ENISA GP-TM-43: IoT devices should be restrictive rather than
   permissive in communicating.

   This Requirement can be enabled and enforced using Manufacturer Usage
   Descriptions, which codify expected communication (See [RFC8520])

   ENISA GP-TM-44: Make intentional connections.  Prevent unauthorised
   connections to it or other devices the product is connected to, at
   all levels of the protocols.

   This requirement can be satisfied through authenticating connections
   (TLS / DTLS mutual authentication.  See [RFC8446] / [RFC9147]) and
   declaring communication patterns (Manufacturer Usage Descriptions.
   See [RFC8520])

   Architectural / Procedural requirements:

Internet-Draft     IoT networking security guidelines       October 2022


   *  ENISA GP-TM-45: Disable specific ports and/or network connections
      for selective connectivity.

   *  ENISA GP-TM-46: Rate limiting.  Controlling the traffic sent or
      received by a network to reduce the risk of automated attacks.

3.12.  Secure Interfaces and network services

   ENISA Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   *  GP-TM-47: Risk Segmentation.  Splitting network elements into
      separate components to help isolate security breaches and minimise
      the overall risk.

   *  GP-TM-48: Protocols should be designed to ensure that, if a single
      device is compromised, it does not affect the whole set.

   *  GP-TM-49: Avoid provisioning the same secret key in an entire
      product family, since compromising a single device would be enough
      to expose the rest of the product family.

   *  GP-TM-50: Ensure only necessary ports are exposed and available.

   *  GP-TM-51: Implement a DDoS-resistant and Load-Balancing
      infrastructure.

   *  GP-TM-53: Avoid security issues when designing error messages.

3.12.1.  Encrypted User Sessions

   ENISA GP-TM-52: Ensure web interfaces fully encrypt the user session,
   from the device to the backend services, and that they are not
   susceptible to XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.

   This requirement can be partially satisfied through use of TLS or
   QUIC (See [RFC8446] and [RFC9000])

3.13.  Secure input and output handling

   Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   ENISA GP-TM-54: Data input validation (ensuring that data is safe
   prior to use) and output filtering.

3.14.  Logging

   Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   ENISA GP-TM-55: Implement a logging system that records events
   relating to user authentication, management of accounts and access
   rights, modifications to security rules, and the functioning of the
   system.  Logs must be preserved on durable storage and retrievable
   via authenticated connections.

   Certain logs can be transported via RATS: See [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].
   Where assosciated with SUIT firmware updates, logs can be transported
   using SUIT Reports.  See [I-D.ietf-suit-report].

3.15.  Monitoring and Auditing

   Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   *  ENISA GP-TM-56: Implement regular monitoring to verify the device
      behaviour, to detect malware and to discover integrity errors.

   *  ENISA GP-TM-57: Conduct periodic audits and reviews of security
      controls to ensure that the controls are effective.  Perform
      penetration tests at least biannually.

4.  Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations are required; they are laid out
   in the preceeding sections.
