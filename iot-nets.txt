      A summary of security-enabling technologies for IoT devices
                 draft-ietf-iotops-security-summary-01

Abstract

   The IETF has developed security technologies that help to secure the
   Internet of Things even over constrained networks and when targetting
   constrained nodes.  These technologies can be used independenly or
   can be composed into larger systems to mitigate a variety of threats.
   This documents illustrates an overview over these technologies and
   highlights their relationships.  Ultimately, a threat model is
   presented as a basis to derive requirements that interconnect
   existing and emerging solution technologies.

1.  Introduction

   This memo serves as an entry-point to detail which technologies are
   available for use in IoT networks and to enable IoT designers to
   discover technologies that may solve their problems.  This draft
   addresses.

   Many baseline security requirements documents have been drafted by
   standards setting organisations, however these documents typically do
   not specify the technologies available to satisfy those requirements.
   They also do not express the next steps if an implementor wants to go
   above and beyond the baseline in order to differentiate their
   products and enable even better security.  This memo defines the
   mapping from some IoT baseline security requirements definitions to
   ietf and related security technologies.  It also highlights some gaps
   in those IoT baseline security requirements.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Survey of baseline security requirements

   At time of writing, there are IoT baseline security requirements
   provided by several organisations:

   *  ENISA's Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT in the context
      of Critical Information Infrastructures ([ENISA-Baseline])

   *  ETSI's Cyber Security for Consumer Internet of Things: Baseline
      Requirements [ETSI-Baseline]

   *  NIST's IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline
      [NIST-Baseline]

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


4.  Requirement Mapping

   Requirements that pertain to hardware, procedure, and policy
   compliance are noted, but do not map to ietf and related
   technologies.  NIST's requirements ([NIST-Baseline]) are very broad
   and already have mappings to ENISA baseline security recommendations.

4.1.  Hardware Security

4.1.1.  Identity

   ENISA GP-PS-10: Establish and maintain asset management procedures
   and configuration controls for key network and information systems.

   NIST Device Identification: The IoT device can be uniquely identified
   logically and physically.

   ETSI Provision 5.4-2: Where a hard-coded unique per device identity
   is used in a device for security purposes, it shall be implemented in
   such a way that it resists tampering by means such as physical,
   electrical or software.

   These requirements are architectural requirements, however [RFC4122]
   can be used for identifiers.

4.1.2.  Hardware Immutable Root of Trust

   ENISA GP-TM-01: Employ a hardware-based immutable root of trust.

   This is an architectural requirement.

4.1.3.  Hardware-Backed Secret Storage

   ENISA GP-TM-02: Use hardware that incorporates security features to
   strengthen the protection and integrity of the device - for example,
   specialized security chips / coprocessors that integrate security at
   the transistor level, embedded in the processor, providing, among
   other things, a trusted storage of device identity and authentication
   means, protection of keys at rest and in use, and preventing
   unprivileged from accessing to security sensitive code.  Protection
   against local and physical attacks can be covered via functional
   security.

   NIST Data Protection: The ability to use demonstrably secure
   cryptographic modules for standardized cryptographic algorithms
   (e.g., encryption with authentication, cryptographic hashes, digital
   signature validation) to prevent the confidentiality and integrity of
   the deviceâ€™s stored and transmitted data from being compromised

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   ETSI Provision 5.4-1: Sensitive security parameters in persistent
   storage shall be stored securely by the device.

   This is an architectural requirement.

4.2.  Software Integrity & Authenticity

4.2.1.  Boot Environment Trustworthiness and Integrity

   ENISA GP-TM-03: Trust must be established in the boot environment
   before any trust in any other software or executable program can be
   claimed.

   ETSI defines the following boot environment requirements:

   *  Provision 5.7-1: The consumer IoT device should verify its
      software using secure boot mechanisms.

   Satisfying this requirement can be done in several ways, increasing
   in security guarantees:

   1.  Implement secure boot to verify the bootloader and boot
       environment.  Trust is established purely by construction: if
       code is running in the boot environment, it must have been
       signed, therefore it is trustworthy.

   2.  Record critical measurements of each step of boot in a TPM.
       Trust is established by evaluating the measurements recorded by
       the TPM.

   3.  Use Remote Attestation.  Remote attestation allows a device to
       report to third parties the critical measurements it has recorded
       (either in a TPM or signed by each stage) in order to prove the
       trustworthiness of the boot environment and running software.
       Remote Attestation is implemented in [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].

4.2.2.  Code Integrity and Authenticity

   ENISA GP-TM-04: Sign code cryptographically to ensure it has not been
   tampered with after signing it as safe for the device, and implement
   run-time protection and secure execution monitoring to make sure
   malicious attacks do not overwrite code after it is loaded.

   Satisfying this requirement requires a secure invocation mechanism.
   In monolithic IoT software images, this is accomplished by Secure
   Boot.  In IoT devices with more fully-featured operating systems,
   this is accomplished with an operating system-specific code signing
   practice.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   Secure Invocation can be achieved using the SUIT Manifest format,
   which provides for secure invocation procedures.  See
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest].

   To satisfy the associated requirement of run-time protection and
   secure execution monitoring, the use of a TEE is recommended to
   protect sensitive processes.  The TEEP protocol (see
   [I-D.ietf-teep-architecture]) is recommended for managing TEEs.

4.2.3.  Secure Software/Firmware Update

   Technical requirements for Software Updates are provided for in the
   SUIT information model ([RFC9124]) and TEEP Architecture ([RFC9397]).
   Procedural and architectural requirements should be independently
   assessed by the implementor.

   ENISA Software Update Requirements:

   *  GP-TM-05: Control the installation of software in operating
      systems, to prevent unauthenticated software and files from being
      loaded onto it.

   *  GP-TM-18: Ensure that the device software/firmware, its
      configuration and its applications have the ability to update
      Over-The-Air (OTA), that the update server is secure, that the
      update file is transmitted via a secure connection, that it does
      not contain sensitive data (e.g. hardcoded credentials), that it
      is signed by an authorised trust entity and encrypted using
      accepted encryption methods, and that the update package has its
      digital signature, signing certificate and signing certificate
      chain, verified by the device before the update process begins.

   *  GP-TM-19: Offer an automatic firmware update mechanism.

   *  GP-TM-20: (Procedural / Architectural) Backward compatibility of
      firmware updates.  Automatic firmware updates should not modify
      user-configured preferences, security, and/or privacy settings
      without user notification.

   NIST Software Update:

   1.  The ability to update the device's software through remote (e.g.,
       network download) and/or local means (e.g., removable media)

   2.  The ability to verify and authenticate any update before
       installing it

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   3.  The ability for authorized entities to roll back updated software
       to a previous version

   4.  The ability to restrict updating actions to authorized entities
       only

   5.  The ability to enable or disable updating

   6.  Configuration settings for use with the Device Configuration
       capability including, but not limited to:

   7.  The ability to configure any remote update mechanisms to be
       either automatically or manually initiated for update downloads
       and installations

   8.  The ability to enable or disable notification when an update is
       available and specify who or what is to be notified

   ETSI Keep Software Updated:

   *  Provision 5.3-1 All software components in consumer IoT devices
      should be securely updateable.

   *  Provision 5.3-2 When the device is not a constrained device, it
      shall have an update mechanism for the secure installation of
      updates.

   *  Provision 5.3-3 An update shall be simple for the user to apply.

   *  Provision 5.3-4 Automatic mechanisms should be used for software
      updates.

   *  Provision 5.3-5 The device should check after initialization, and
      then periodically, whether security updates are available.

   *  Provision 5.3-6 If the device supports automatic updates and/or
      update notifications, these should be enabled in the initialized
      state and configurable so that the user can enable, disable, or
      postpone installation of security updates and/or update
      notifications.

   *  Provision 5.3-7 The device shall use best practice cryptography to
      facilitate secure update mechanisms.

   *  Provision 5.3-8 Security updates shall be timely.

   *  Provision 5.3-9 The device should verify the authenticity and
      integrity of software updates.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  Provision 5.3-10 Where updates are delivered over a network
      interface, the device shall verify the authenticity and integrity
      of each update via a trust relationship.

   *  Provision 5.3-11 The manufacturer should inform the user in a
      recognizable and apparent manner that a security update is
      required together with information on the risks mitigated by that
      update.

   *  Provision 5.3-12 The device should notify the user when the
      application of a software update will disrupt the basic
      functioning of the device.

   *  Provision 5.3-13 The manufacturer shall publish, in an accessible
      way that is clear and transparent to the user, the defined support
      period.

   *  Provision 5.3-14 For constrained devices that cannot have their
      software updated, the rationale for the absence of software
      updates, the period and method of hardware replacement support and
      a defined support period should be published by the manufacturer
      in an accessible way that is clear and transparent to the user.

   *  Provision 5.3-15 For constrained devices that cannot have their
      software updated, the product should be isolable and the hardware
      replaceable.

   *  Provision 5.3-16 The model designation of the consumer IoT device
      shall be clearly recognizable, either by labelling on the device
      or via a physical interface.

   *  Provision 5.5-3 Cryptographic algorithms and primitives should be
      updateable.

   Many fully-featured operating systems have dedicated means of
   implementing this requirement.  The SUIT manifest (See
   [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]) is recommended as a means of providing
   secure, authenticated software update, including for constrained
   devices.  Where the software is deployed to a TEE, TEEP (See
   [I-D.ietf-teep-protocol]) is recommended for software update and
   management.

4.2.4.  Configuration

   NIST Device Configuration:

   1.  The ability to change the device's software configuration
       settings

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   2.  The ability to restrict configuration changes to authorized
       entities only

   3.  The ability for authorized entities to restore the device to a
       secure configuration defined by an authorized entity

   ETSI defines the following configuration requirements:

   *  Provision 5.12-1: Installation and maintenance of consumer IoT
      should involve minimal decisions by the user and should follow
      security best practice on usability.

   *  Provision 5.12-2 The manufacturer should provide users with
      guidance on how to securely set up their device.

   *  Provision 5.12-3 The manufacturer should provide users with
      guidance on how to check whether their device is securely set up.

   Configuration can be delivered to a device either via a firmware
   update, such as in [I-D.ietf-suit-manifest], or via a runtime
   configuration interface, such as [LwM2M].

4.2.5.  Resilience to Failure

   ENISA GP-TM-06: Enable a system to return to a state that was known
   to be secure, after a security breach has occured or if an upgrade
   has not been successful.

   ETSI defines the following resilience requirements:

   *  Provision 5.9-1: Resilience should be built in to consumer IoT
      devices and services, taking into account the possibility of
      outages of data networks and power.

   *  Provision 5.9-2: Consumer IoT devices should remain operating and
      locally functional in the case of a loss of network access and
      should recover cleanly in the case of restoration of a loss of
      power.

   *  Provision 5.9-3: The consumer IoT device should connect to
      networks in an expected, operational and stable state and in an
      orderly fashion, taking the capability of the infrastructure into
      consideration.

   While there is no specificaiton for this, it is also required in
   [RFC9019]

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


4.2.6.  Trust Anchor Management

   ENISA GP-TM-07: Use protocols and mechanisms able to represent and
   manage trust and trust relationships.

   EST (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030) and LwM2M
   Bootstrap ([LwM2M]) provide a mechanism to replace trust anchors
   (manage trust/trust relationships).

4.3.  Default Security & Privacy

4.3.1.  Security ON by Default

   ENISA GP-TM-08: Any applicable security features should be enabled by
   default, and any unused or insecure functionalities should be
   disabled by default.

   NIST Logical Access to Interfaces:

   1.  The ability to logically or physically disable any local and
       network interfaces that are not necessary for the core
       functionality of the device

   2.  The ability to logically restrict access to each network
       interface to only authorized entities (e.g., device
       authentication, user authentication)

   3.  Configuration settings for use with the Device Configuration
       capability including, but not limited to, the ability to enable,
       disable, and adjust thresholds for any ability the device might
       have to lock or disable an account or to delay additional
       authentication attempts after too many failed authentication
       attempts

   ETSI Minimize exposed attack surfaces:

   *  Provision 5.6-1: All unused network and logical interfaces shall
      be disabled.

   *  Provision 5.6-2: In the initialized state, the network interfaces
      of the device shall minimize the unauthenticated disclosure of
      security-relevant information.

   *  Provision 5.6-5: The manufacturer should only enable software
      services that are used or required for the intended use or
      operation of the device.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  Provision 5.6-6: Code should be minimized to the functionality
      necessary for the service/device to operate.

   *  Provision 5.6-7: Software should run with least necessary
      privileges, taking account of both security and functionality.

   These are procedural requirements, rather than a protocol or document
   requirement.

4.3.2.  Default Unique Passwords

   ENISA GP-TM-09: Establish hard to crack, device-individual default
   passwords.

   ETSI Provision 5.1-1: Where passwords are used and in any state other
   than the factory default, all consumer IoT device passwords shall be
   unique per device or defined by the user.

   This is a procedural requirement, rather than a protocol or document
   requirement.

4.4.  Data Protection

   The data protection requirements are largely procedural/
   architectural.  While this memo can recommend using TEEs to protect
   data, and TEEP ([I-D.ietf-teep-architecture]) to manage TEEs,
   implementors must choose to architect their software in such a way
   that TEEs are helpful in meeting these requirements.

   ENISA Data Protection requirements:

   *  GP-TM-10: Personal data must be collected and processed fairly and
      lawfully, it should never be collected and processed without the
      data subject's consent.

   *  GP-TM-11: Make sure that personal data is used for the specified
      purposes for which they were collected, and that any further
      processing of personal data is compatible and that the data
      subjects are well informed.

   *  GP-TM-12: Minimise the data collected and retained.

   *  GP-TM-13: IoT stakeholders must be compliant with the EU General
      Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  GP-TM-14: Users of IoT products and services must be able to
      exercise their rights to information, access, erasure,
      rectification, data portability, restriction of processing,
      objection to processing, and their right not to be evaluated on
      the basis of automated processing.

   NIST Data Protection:

   1.  The ability to use demonstrably secure cryptographic modules for
       standardized cryptographic algorithms (e.g., encryption with
       authentication, cryptographic hashes, digital signature
       validation) to prevent the confidentiality and integrity of the
       device's stored and transmitted data from being compromised

   2.  The ability for authorized entities to render all data on the
       device inaccessible by all entities, whether previously
       authorized or not (e.g., through a wipe of internal storage,
       destruction of cryptographic keys for encrypted data)

   3.  Configuration settings for use with the Device Configuration
       capability including, but not limited to, the ability for
       authorized entities to configure the cryptography use itself,
       such as choosing a key length

   ETSI Data Protection requirements:

   *  Provision 5.8-3: All external sensing capabilities of the device
      shall be documented in an accessible way that is clear and
      transparent for the user.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  Provision 6-1: The manufacturer shall provide consumers with clear
      and transparent information about what personal data is processed,
      how it is being used, by whom, and for what purposes, for each
      device and service.  This also applies to third parties that can
      be involved, including advertisers.

   *  Provision 6-2: Where personal data is processed on the basis of
      consumers' consent, this consent shall be obtained in a valid way.

   *  Provision 6-3: Consumers who gave consent for the processing of
      their personal data shall have the capability to withdraw it at
      any time.

   *  Provision 6-4: If telemetry data is collected from consumer IoT
      devices and services, the processing of personal data should be
      kept to the minimum necessary for the intended functionality.

   *  Provision 6-5: If telemetry data is collected from consumer IoT
      devices and services, consumers shall be provided with information
      on what telemetry data is collected, how it is being used, by
      whom, and for what purposes.

4.5.  System Safety and Reliability

   Safety and reliability requirements are procedural/architectural.
   Implementors should ensure they have processes and architectures in
   place to meet these requirements.

   ENISA Safety and Reliability requirements:

   *  GP-TM-15: Design with system and operational disruption in mind,
      preventing the system from causing an unacceptable risk of injury
      or physical damage.

   *  GP-TM-16: Mechanisms for self-diagnosis and self-repair/healing to
      recover from failure, malfunction or a compromised state.

   *  GP-TM-17: Ensure standalone operation - essential features should
      continue to work with a loss of communications and chronicle
      negative impacts from compromised devices or cloud-based systems.

4.6.  Authentication

   ETSI architectural requirements:

   *  Provision 5.1-4 Where a user can authenticate against a device,
      the device shall provide to the user or an administrator a simple
      mechanism to change the authentication value used.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  Provision 5.1-5 When the device is not a constrained device, it
      shall have a mechanism available which makes brute-force attacks
      on authentication mechanisms via network interfaces impracticable.

   EST (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030) and LwM2M
   Bootstrap ([LwM2M]) provide a mechanism to replace trust anchors
   (manage trust/trust relationships) and perform other forms of
   credential management (Provision 5.1-4).

4.6.1.  Align Authentication Schemes with Threat Models

   ENISA GP-TM-21: Design the authentication and authorisation schemes
   (unique per device) based on the system-level threat models.

   This is a procedural / architectural requirement.

4.6.2.  Password Rules

   ENISA applies the following requirements to Password-based
   authentication:

   *  GP-TM-22: Ensure that default passwords and even default usernames
      are changed during the initial setup, and that weak, null or blank
      passwords are not allowed.

   *  GP-TM-23: Authentication mechanisms must use strong passwords or
      personal identification numbers (PINs), and should consider using
      two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication
      (MFA) like Smartphones, Biometrics, etc., on top of certificates.

   *  GP-TM-24: Authentication credentials shall be salted, hashed and/
      or encrypted.

   *  GP-TM-25: Protect against 'brute force' and/or other abusive login
      attempts.  This protection should also consider keys stored in
      devices.

   *  GP-TM-26: Ensure password recovery or reset mechanism is robust
      and does not supply an attacker with information indicating a
      valid account.  The same applies to key update and recovery
      mechanisms.

   ETSI applies a the following requirements to password-based
   authentication:

   *  Provision 5.1-1: Where passwords are used and in any state other
      than the factory default, all consumer IoT device passwords shall
      be unique per device or defined by the user.



Moran                     Expires 25 April 2024                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  Provision 5.1-2 Where pre-installed unique per device passwords
      are used, these shall be generated with a mechanism that reduces
      the risk of automated attacks against a class or type of device.

   As an alternative, implementors are encouraged to consider
   passwordless schemes, such as FIDO.

4.7.  Authorisation

4.7.1.  Principle of Least Privilege

   ENISA GP-TM-27: Limit the actions allowed for a given system by
   Implementing fine-grained authorisation mechanisms and using the
   Principle of least privilege (POLP): applications must operate at the
   lowest privilege level possible.

   This is a procedural / architectural requirement, however at the
   network level, this can be implemented using Manufacturer Usage
   Descriptions (see [RFC8520]).

4.7.2.  Software Isolation

   ENISA GP-TM-28: Device firmware should be designed to isolate
   privileged code, processes and data from portions of the firmware
   that do not need access to them.  Device hardware should provide
   isolation concepts to prevent unprivileged from accessing security
   sensitive code.

   Implementors should use TEEs to address this requirement.  The
   provisioning and management of TEEs can be accomplished using TEEP
   (see [I-D.ietf-teep-architecture]).

   ETSI Provision 5.6-8: The device should include a hardware-level
   access control mechanism for memory.

   Implementors should enable and correctly configure the MPU(s) and
   MMU(s) that are present in most devices.

4.7.3.  Access Control

   ENISA Requirements:

   *  GP-TM-29: Data integrity and confidentiality must be enforced by
      access controls.  When the subject requesting access has been
      authorised to access particular processes, it is necessary to
      enforce the defined security policy.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  GP-TM-30: Ensure a context-based security and privacy that
      reflects different levels of importance.

   These requirements are complex and require a variety of technologies
   to implement.  Use of TEEs can provide a building block for these
   requirements, but is not sufficient in itself to meet these
   requiremnents.

   ETSI Requirements:

   *  Provision 5.5-4: Access to device functionality via a network
      interface in the initialized state should only be possible after
      authentication on that interface.

   *  Provision 5.5-5: Device functionality that allows security-
      relevant changes in configuration via a network interface shall
      only be accessible after authentication.  The exception is for
      network service protocols that are relied upon by the device and
      where the manufacturer cannot guarantee what configuration will be
      required for the device to operate.

   *  Provision 5.5-5: Device functionality that allows security-
      relevant changes in configuration via a network interface shall
      only be accessible after authentication.  The exception is for
      network service protocols that are relied upon by the device and
      where the manufacturer cannot guarantee what configuration will be
      required for the device to operate.

4.8.  Environmental and Physical Security

   ENISA defines the following physical security requirements.  These
   are hardware-architectural requirements and not covered by protocol
   and format specifications.

   *  GP-TM-31: Measures for tamper protection and detection.  Detection
      and reaction to hardware tampering should not rely on network
      connectivity.

   *  GP-TM-32: Ensure that the device cannot be easily disassembled and
      that the data storage medium is encrypted at rest and cannot be
      easily removed.

   *  GP-TM-33: Ensure that devices only feature the essential physical
      external ports (such as USB) necessary for them to function and
      that the test/debug modes are secure, so they cannot be used to
      maliciously access the devices.  In general, lock down physical
      ports to only trusted connections.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   ETSI defines the following physical security requirements:

   *  Provision 5.6-3: Device hardware should not unnecessarily expose
      physical interfaces to attack.

   *  Provision 5.6-4: Where a debug interface is physically accessible,
      it shall be disabled in software.

4.9.  Cryptography

   ENISA makes the following architectural cryptography requirements for
   IoT devices:

   *  GP-TM-34: Ensure a proper and effective use of cryptography to
      protect the confidentiality, authenticity and/or integrity of data
      and information (including control messages), in transit and in
      rest.  Ensure the proper selection of standard and strong
      encryption algorithms and strong keys, and disable insecure
      protocols.  Verify the robustness of the implementation.

   *  GP-TM-35: Cryptographic keys must be securely managed.

   *  GP-TM-36: Build devices to be compatible with lightweight
      encryption and security techniques.

   *  GP-TM-37: Support scalable key management schemes.

   ETSI makes the following architectural cryptography requirement for
   IoT devices:

   *  Provision 5.1-3: Authentication mechanisms used to authenticate
      users against a device shall use best practice cryptography,
      appropriate to the properties of the technology, risk and usage.

   *  Provision 5.4-3: Hard-coded critical security parameters in device
      software source code shall not be used.

   *  Provision 5.4-4: Any critical security parameters used for
      integrity and authenticity checks of software updates and for
      protection of communication with associated services in device
      software shall be unique per device and shall be produced with a
      mechanism that reduces the risk of automated attacks against
      classes of devices.

   *  Provision 5.5-3: Cryptographic algorithms and primitives should be
      updateable.

4.10.  Secure and Trusted Communications

4.10.1.  Data Security

   ENISA GP-TM-38: Guarantee the different security aspects
   -confidentiality (privacy), integrity, availability and authenticity-
   of the information in transit on the networks or stored in the IoT
   application or in the Cloud.

   ETSI Data Security Requirements:

   *  Provision 5.5-6: Critical security parameters should be encrypted
      in transit, with such encryption appropriate to the properties of
      the technology, risk and usage.

   *  Provision 5.5-7 The consumer IoT device shall protect the
      confidentiality of critical security parameters that are
      communicated via remotely accessible network interfaces.

   *  Provision 5.5-8 The manufacturer shall follow secure management
      processes for critical security parameters that relate to the
      device.

   *  Provision 5.8-1 The confidentiality of personal data transiting
      between a device and a service, especially associated services,
      should be protected, with best practice cryptography.

   *  Provision 5.8-2 The confidentiality of sensitive personal data
      communicated between the device and associated services shall be
      protected, with cryptography appropriate to the properties of the
      technology and usage.

   This Data Security requirement can be fulfilled using COSE [RFC8152]
   for ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data
   either in transit or at rest.  Secure Transport (see Section 4.10.2)
   technologies can be used to protect data in transit.

4.10.2.  Secure Transport

   ENISA Requirements:

   *  GP-TM-39: Ensure that communication security is provided using
      state-of-the-art, standardised security protocols, such as TLS for
      encryption.

   *  GP-TM-40: Ensure credentials are not exposed in internal or
      external network traffic.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   ETSI Requirements:

   *  Provision 5.5-1: The consumer IoT device shall use best practice
      cryptography to communicate securely.

   *  Provision 5.5-2: The consumer IoT device should use reviewed or
      evaluated implementations to deliver network and security
      functionalities, particularly in the field of cryptography.

   *  Provision 5.5-4: Access to device functionality via a network
      interface in the initialized state should only be possible after
      authentication on that interface.

   This requirement is satisfied by several standards:

   *  TLS ([RFC8446]).

   *  DTLS ([RFC9147]).

   *  QUIC ([RFC9000]).

   *  OSCORE ([RFC9203]).

4.10.3.  Data Authenticity

   ENISA GP-TM-41: Guarantee data authenticity to enable reliable
   exchanges from data emission to data reception.  Data should always
   be signed whenever and wherever it is captured and stored.

   The authenticity of data can be protected using COSE [RFC8152].

   ENISA GP-TM-42: Do not trust data received and always verify any
   interconnections.  Discover, identify and verify/authenticate the
   devices connected to the network before trust can be established, and
   preserve their integrity for reliable solutions and services.

   Verifying communication partners can be done in many ways.  Key
   technologies supporting authentication of communication partners are:

   *  RATS: Remote attestation of a communication partner (See
      [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]).

   *  TLS/DTLS: Mutual authentication of communication partners (See
      [RFC8446] / [RFC9147]).

   *  ATLS: Application-layer TLS for authenticating a connection that
      may traverse multiple secure transport connections.

Internet-Draft       IoT networking security summary        October 2023


   *  Attested TLS: The use of attestation in session establishment in
      TLS (See [I-D.fossati-tls-attestation]).

4.10.4.  Least Privilege Communication

   ENISA GP-TM-43: IoT devices should be restrictive rather than
   permissive in communicating.

   This Requirement can be enabled and enforced using Manufacturer Usage
   Descriptions, which codify expected communication (See [RFC8520])

   ENISA GP-TM-44: Make intentional connections.  Prevent unauthorised
   connections to it or other devices the product is connected to, at
   all levels of the protocols.

   This requirement can be satisfied through authenticating connections
   (TLS / DTLS mutual authentication.  See [RFC8446] / [RFC9147]) and
   declaring communication patterns (Manufacturer Usage Descriptions.
   See [RFC8520])

   Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   *  ENISA GP-TM-45: Disable specific ports and/or network connections
      for selective connectivity.

   *  ENISA GP-TM-46: Rate limiting.  Controlling the traffic sent or
      received by a network to reduce the risk of automated attacks.

4.11.  Secure Interfaces and network services

   ENISA Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   *  GP-TM-47: Risk Segmentation.  Splitting network elements into
      separate components to help isolate security breaches and minimise
      the overall risk.

   *  GP-TM-48: Protocols should be designed to ensure that, if a single
      device is compromised, it does not affect the whole set.

   *  GP-TM-49: Avoid provisioning the same secret key in an entire
      product family, since compromising a single device would be enough
      to expose the rest of the product family.

   *  GP-TM-50: Ensure only necessary ports are exposed and available.

   *  GP-TM-51: Implement a DDoS-resistant and Load-Balancing
      infrastructure.

   *  GP-TM-53: Avoid security issues when designing error messages.

   ETSI Architectural requirements:

   *  Provision 5.1-5 When the device is not a constrained device, it
      shall have a mechanism available which makes brute-force attacks
      on authentication mechanisms via network interfaces impracticable.

4.11.1.  Encrypted User Sessions

   ENISA GP-TM-52: Ensure web interfaces fully encrypt the user session,
   from the device to the backend services, and that they are not
   susceptible to XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.

   This requirement can be partially satisfied through use of TLS or
   QUIC (See [RFC8446] and [RFC9000])

4.12.  Secure input and output handling

   Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   ENISA GP-TM-54: Data input validation (ensuring that data is safe
   prior to use) and output filtering.

   ETSI Provision 5.13-1: The consumer IoT device software shall
   validate data input via user interfaces or transferred via
   Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or between networks in
   services and devices.

4.13.  Logging

   Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   ENISA GP-TM-55: Implement a logging system that records events
   relating to user authentication, management of accounts and access
   rights, modifications to security rules, and the functioning of the
   system.  Logs must be preserved on durable storage and retrievable
   via authenticated connections.

   NIST Cybersecurity State Awareness

   1.  The ability to report the device's cybersecurity state

   2.  The ability to differentiate between when a device will likely
       operate as expected from when it may be in a degraded
       cybersecurity state

   3.  The ability to restrict access to the state indicator so only
       authorized entities can view it

   4.  The ability to prevent any entities (authorized or unauthorized)
       from editing the state except for those entities that are
       responsible for maintaining the device's state information

   5.  The ability to make the state information available to a service
       on another device, such as an event/state log server

   ETSI defines the following logging requirements:

   *  Provision 5.7-2: If an unauthorized change is detected to the
      software, the device should alert the user and/or administrator to
      the issue and should not connect to wider networks than those
      necessary to perform the alerting function.

   Certain logs and indicators of cybersecurity state can be transported
   via RATS: See [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].  Where associated with SUIT
   firmware updates, logs can be transported using SUIT Reports.  See
   [I-D.ietf-suit-report].

4.14.  Monitoring and Auditing

   ENISA Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   *  ENISA GP-TM-56: Implement regular monitoring to verify the device
      behaviour, to detect malware and to discover integrity errors.

   *  ENISA GP-TM-57: Conduct periodic audits and reviews of security
      controls to ensure that the controls are effective.  Perform
      penetration tests at least biannually.

   ETSI Architectural / Procedural requirements:

   *  Provision 5.2-1: The manufacturer shall make a vulnerability
      disclosure policy publicly available.

   *  Provision 5.2-2: Disclosed vulnerabilities should be acted on in a
      timely manner.

   *  Provision 5.2-3: Manufacturers should continually monitor for,
      identify and rectify security vulnerabilities within products and
      services they sell, produce, have produced and services they
      operate during the defined support period.

   *  Provision 5.6-9: The manufacturer should follow secure development
      processes for software deployed on the device.

   *  Provision 5.10-1 If telemetry data is collected from consumer IoT
      devices and services, such as usage and measurement data, it
      should be examined for security anomalies.

   Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust
   ([I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture]) enables monitoring for inclusion of
   disclosed vulnerabilities within products and services, so can be
   used to satisfy Provision 5.2-3.
