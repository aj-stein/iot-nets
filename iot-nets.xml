    <abstract>


<t>The IETF has developed security technologies that help to secure the Internet of Things even over constrained networks and when targetting constrained nodes. These technologies can be used independenly or can be composed into larger systems to mitigate a variety of threats. This documents illustrates an overview over these technologies and highlights their relationships. Ultimately, a threat model is presented as a basis to derive requirements that interconnect existing and emerging solution technologies.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>This memo serves as an entry-point to detail which technologies are available for use in IoT networks and to enable IoT designers to discover technologies that may solve their problems. This draft addresses.</t>

<t>Many baseline security requirements documents have been drafted by standards setting organisations, however these documents typically do not specify the technologies available to satisfy those requirements. They also do not express the next steps if an implementor wants to go above and beyond the baseline in order to differentiate their products and enable even better security. This memo defines the mapping from some IoT baseline security requirements definitions to ietf and related security technologies. It also highlights some gaps in those IoT baseline security requirements.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="survey-of-baseline-security-requirements"><name>Survey of baseline security requirements</name>

<t>At time of writing, there are IoT baseline security requirements provided by several organisations:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>ENISA's Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT in the context of Critical Information Infrastructures (<xref target="ENISA-Baseline"/>)</t>
  <t>ETSI's Cyber Security for Consumer Internet of Things: Baseline Requirements <xref target="ETSI-Baseline"/></t>

<section anchor="requirement-mapping"><name>Requirement Mapping</name>

<t>Requirements that pertain to hardware, procedure, and policy compliance are noted, but do not map to ietf and related technologies.</t>

<section anchor="hardware-security"><name>Hardware Security</name>

<section anchor="hardware-immutable-root-of-trust"><name>Hardware Immutable Root of Trust</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-01: Employ a hardware-based immutable root of trust.</t>

<t>This is an architectural requirement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="hardware-backed-secret-storage"><name>Hardware-Backed Secret Storage</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-02: Use hardware that incorporates security features to strengthen the protection and integrity of the device - for example, specialised security chips / coprocessors that integrate security at the transistor level, embedded in the processor, providing, among other things, a trusted storage of device identity and authentication means, protection of keys at rest and in use, and preventing unprivileged from accessing to security sensitive code. Protection against local and physical attacks can be covered via functional security.</t>

<t>This is an architectural requirement.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="software-integrity-authenticity"><name>Software Integrity &amp; Authenticity</name>

<section anchor="boot-environment-trustworthiness-and-integrity"><name>Boot Environment Trustworthiness and Integrity</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-03: Trust must be established in the boot environment before any trust in any other software or executable program can be claimed.</t>

<t>Satisfying this requirement can be done in several ways, increasing in security guarantees:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Implement secure boot to verify the bootloader and boot environment. Trust is established purely by construction: if code is running in the boot environment, it must have been signed, therefore it is trustworthy.</t>
  <t>Record critical measurements of each step of boot in a TPM. Trust is established by evaluating the measurements recorded by the TPM.</t>
  <t>Use Remote Attestation. Remote attestation allows a device to report to third parties the critical measurements it has recorded (either in a TPM or signed by each stage) in order to prove the trustworthiness of the boot environment and running software. Remote Attestation is implemented in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rats-eat"/>.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="code-integrity-and-authenticity"><name>Code Integrity and Authenticity</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-04: Sign code cryptographically to ensure it has not been tampered with after signing it as safe for the device, and implement run-time protection and secure execution monitoring to make sure malicious attacks do not overwrite code after it is loaded.</t>

<t>Satisfying this requirement requires a secure invocation mechanism. In monolithic IoT software images, this is accomplished by Secure Boot. In IoT devices with more fully-featured operating systems, this is accomplished with an operating system-specific code signing practice.</t>

<t>Secure Invocation can be achieved using the SUIT Manifest format, which provides for secure invocation procedures. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>.</t>

<t>To satisfy the associated requirement of run-time protection and secure execution monitoring, the use of a TEE is recommended to protect sensitive processes. The TEEP protocol (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-teep-architecture"/>) is recommended for managing TEEs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="secure-firmware-update"><name>Secure Firmware Update</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-05: Control the installation of software in operating systems, to prevent unauthenticated software and files from being loaded onto it.</t>

<t>Many fully-featured operating systems have dedicated means of implementing this requirement. The SUIT manifest (See <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>) is recommended as a means of providing secure, authenticated software update. Where the software is deployed to a TEE, TEEP (See <xref target="I-D.ietf-teep-protocol"/>) is recommended for software update and management.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resilience-to-failure"><name>Resilience to Failure</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-06: Enable a system to return to a state that was known to be secure, after a security breach has occured or if an upgrade has not been successful.</t>

<t>While there is no specificaiton for this, it is also required in <xref target="RFC9019"/></t>

</section>
<section anchor="trust-anchor-management"><name>Trust Anchor Management</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-07: Use protocols and mechanisms able to represent and manage trust and trust relationships.</t>

<t>EST (<eref target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030"/>) and LwM2M Bootstrap (<xref target="LwM2M"/>) provide a mechanism to replace trust anchors (manage trust/trust relationships).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="default-security-privacy"><name>Default Security &amp; Privacy</name>

<section anchor="security-on-by-default"><name>Security ON by Default</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-08: Any applicable security features should be enabled by default, and any unused or insecure functionalities should be disabled by default.</t>

<t>This is a procedural requirement, rather than a protocol or document requirement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="default-unique-passwords"><name>Default Unique Passwords</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-09: Establish hard to crack, device-individual default passwords.</t>

<t>This is a procedural requirement, rather than a protocol or document requirement.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="data-protection"><name>Data Protection</name>

<t>The data protection requirements are largely procedural/architectural. While this memo can recommend using TEEs to protect data, and TEEP (<xref target="I-D.ietf-teep-architecture"/>) to manage TEEs, implementors must choose to architect their software in such a way that TEEs are helpful in meeting these requirements.</t>

<t>ENISA Data Protection requirements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>GP-TM-10: Personal data must be collected and processed fairly and lawfully, it should never be collected and processed without the data subject's consent.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-11: Make sure that personal data is used for the specified purposes for which they were collected, and that any further processing of personal data is compatible and that the data subjects are well informed.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-12: Minimise the data collected and retained.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-13: IoT stakeholders must be compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</t>
  <t>GP-TM-14: Users of IoT products and services must be able to exercise their rights to information, access, erasure, rectification, data portability, restriction of processing, objection to processing, and their right not to be evaluated on the basis of automated processing.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="system-safety-and-reliability"><name>System Safety and Reliability</name>

<t>Safety and reliability requirements are procedural/architectural. Implementors should ensure they have processes and architectures in place to meet these requirements.</t>

<t>ENISA Safety and Reliability requirements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>GP-TM-15: Design with system and operational disruption in mind, preventing the system from causing an unacceptable risk of injury or physical damage.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-16: Mechanisms for self-diagnosis and self-repair/healing to recover from failure, malfunction or a compromised state.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-17: Ensure standalone operation - essential features should continue to work with a loss of communications and chronicle negative impacts from compromised devices or cloud-based systems.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="secure-software-firmware-updates"><name>Secure Software / Firmware updates</name>

<t>Technical requirements for Software Updates are provided for in SUIT (<xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-manifest"/>) and TEEP (<xref target="I-D.ietf-teep-protocol"/>). Procedural and architectural requirements should be independently assessed by the implementor.</t>

<t>ENISA Software Update Requirements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>GP-TM-18: Ensure that the device software/firmware, its configuration and its applications have the ability to update Over-The-Air (OTA), that the update server is secure, that the update file is transmitted via a secure connection, that it does not contain sensitive data (e.g. hardcoded credentials), that it is signed by an authorised trust entity and encrypted using accepted encryption methods, and that the update package has its digital signature, signing certificate and signing certificate chain, verified by the device before the update process begins.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-19: Offer an automatic firmware update mechanism.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-20: (Procedural / Architectural) Backward compatibility of firmware updates. Automatic firmware updates should not modify user-configured preferences, security, and/or privacy settings without user notification.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="authentication"><name>Authentication</name>

<section anchor="align-authentication-schemes-with-threat-models"><name>Align Authentication Schemes with Threat Models</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-21: Design the authentication and authorisation schemes (unique per device) based on the system-level threat models.</t>

<t>This is a procedural / architectural requirement.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="password-rules"><name>Password Rules</name>

<t>ENISA applies the following requirements to Password-based authentication:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>GP-TM-22: Ensure that default passwords and even default usernames are changed during the initial setup, and that weak, null or blank passwords are not allowed.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-23: Authentication mechanisms must use strong passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs), and should consider using two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) like Smartphones, Biometrics, etc., on top of certificates.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-24: Authentication credentials shall be salted, hashed and/or encrypted.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-25: Protect against 'brute force' and/or other abusive login attempts. This protection should also consider keys stored in devices.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-26: Ensure password recovery or reset mechanism is robust and does not supply an attacker with information indicating a valid account. The same applies to key update and recovery mechanisms.</t>
</list></t>

<t>As an alternative, implementors are encouraged to consider passwordless schemes, such as FIDO.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="authorisation"><name>Authorisation</name>

<section anchor="principle-of-least-privilege"><name>Principle of Least Privilege</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-27: Limit the actions allowed for a given system by Implementing fine-grained authorisation mechanisms and using the Principle of least privilege (POLP): applications must operate at the lowest privilege level possible.</t>

<t>This is a procedural / architectural requirement, however at the network level, this can be implemented using Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (see <xref target="RFC8520"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="software-isolation"><name>Software Isolation</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-28: Device firmware should be designed to isolate privileged code, processes and data from portions of the firmware that do not need access to them. Device hardware should provide isolation concepts to prevent unprivileged from accessing security sensitive code.</t>

<t>Implementors should use TEEs to address this requirement. The provisioning and management of TEEs can be accomplished using TEEP (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-teep-architecture"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="access-control"><name>Access Control</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-29: Data integrity and confidentiality must be enforced by access controls. When the subject requesting access has been authorised to access particular processes, it is necessary to enforce the defined security policy.
ENISA GP-TM-30: Ensure a context-based security and privacy that reflects different levels of importance.</t>

<t>These requirements are complex and require a variety of technologies to implement. Use of TEEs can provide a building block for these requirements, but is not sufficient in itself to meet these requiremnents.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="environmental-and-physical-security"><name>Environmental and Physical Security</name>

<t>ENISA defines the following physical security requirements. These are hardware-architectural requirements and not covered by protocol and format specifications.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>GP-TM-31: Measures for tamper protection and detection. Detection and reaction to hardware
tampering should not rely on network connectivity.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-32: Ensure that the device cannot be easily disassembled and that the data storage medium is encrypted at rest and cannot be easily removed.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-33: Ensure that devices only feature the essential physical external ports (such as USB) necessary for them to function and that the test/debug modes are secure, so they cannot be used to maliciously access the devices. In general, lock down physical ports to only trusted connections.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="cryptography"><name>Cryptography</name>

<t>ENISA makes the following architectural cryptography requirements for IoT devices:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>GP-TM-34: Ensure a proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity and/or integrity of data and information (including control messages), in transit and in rest. Ensure the proper selection of standard and strong encryption algorithms and strong keys, and disable insecure protocols. Verify the robustness of the implementation.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-35: Cryptographic keys must be securely managed.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-36: Build devices to be compatible with lightweight encryption and security techniques.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-37: Support scalable key management schemes.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="secure-and-trusted-communications"><name>Secure and Trusted Communications</name>

<section anchor="data-security"><name>Data Security</name>

<t>GP-TM-38: Guarantee the different security aspects -confidentiality (privacy), integrity, availability and authenticity- of the information in transit on the networks or stored in the IoT application or in the Cloud.</t>

<t>This Data Security requirement can be fulfilled using COSE <xref target="RFC8152"/> for ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data either in transit or at rest. Secure Transport (see <xref target="secure-transport"/>) technologies can be used to protect data in transit.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="secure-transport"><name>Secure Transport</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-39: Ensure that communication security is provided using state-of-the-art, standardised security protocols, such as TLS for encryption.
ENISA GP-TM-40: Ensure credentials are not exposed in internal or external network traffic.</t>

<t>This requirement is satisfied by several standards:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>TLS (<xref target="RFC8446"/>).</t>
  <t>DTLS (<xref target="RFC9147"/>).</t>
  <t>QUIC (<xref target="RFC9000"/>).</t>
  <t>OSCORE (<xref target="RFC9203"/>).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="data-authenticity"><name>Data Authenticity</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-41: Guarantee data authenticity to enable reliable exchanges from data emission to data reception. Data should always be signed whenever and wherever it is captured and stored.</t>

<t>The authenticity of data can be protected using COSE <xref target="RFC8152"/>.</t>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-42: Do not trust data received and always verify any interconnections. Discover, identify and verify/authenticate the devices connected to the network before trust can be established, and preserve
their integrity for reliable solutions and services.</t>

<t>Verifying communication partners can be done in many ways. Key technologies supporting authentication of communication partners are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>RATS: Remote attestation of a communication partner (See <xref target="I-D.ietf-rats-architecture"/>).</t>
  <t>TLS/DTLS: Mutual authentication of communication partners (See <xref target="RFC8446"/> / <xref target="RFC9147"/>).</t>
  <t>ATLS: Application-layer TLS for authenticating a connection that may traverse multiple secure transport connections.</t>
  <t>Attested TLS: The use of attestation in session establishment in TLS (See <xref target="I-D.fossati-tls-attestation"/>).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="least-privilege-communication"><name>Least Privilege Communication</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-43: IoT devices should be restrictive rather than permissive in communicating.</t>

<t>This Requirement can be enabled and enforced using Manufacturer Usage Descriptions, which codify expected communication (See <xref target="RFC8520"/>)</t>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-44: Make intentional connections. Prevent unauthorised connections to it or other devices the
product is connected to, at all levels of the protocols.</t>

<t>This requirement can be satisfied through authenticating connections (TLS / DTLS mutual authentication. See <xref target="RFC8446"/> / <xref target="RFC9147"/>) and declaring communication patterns (Manufacturer Usage Descriptions. See <xref target="RFC8520"/>)</t>

<t>Architectural / Procedural requirements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>ENISA GP-TM-45: Disable specific ports and/or network connections for selective connectivity.</t>
  <t>ENISA GP-TM-46: Rate limiting. Controlling the traffic sent or received by a network to reduce the risk of automated attacks.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="secure-interfaces-and-network-services"><name>Secure Interfaces and network services</name>

<t>ENISA Architectural / Procedural requirements:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>GP-TM-47: Risk Segmentation. Splitting network elements into separate components to help isolate security breaches and minimise the overall risk.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-48: Protocols should be designed to ensure that, if a single device is compromised, it does not affect the whole set.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-49: Avoid provisioning the same secret key in an entire product family, since compromising a single device would be enough to expose the rest of the product family.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-50: Ensure only necessary ports are exposed and available.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-51: Implement a DDoS-resistant and Load-Balancing infrastructure.</t>
  <t>GP-TM-53: Avoid security issues when designing error messages.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="encrypted-user-sessions"><name>Encrypted User Sessions</name>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-52: Ensure web interfaces fully encrypt the user session, from the device to the backend services, and that they are not susceptible to XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.</t>

<t>This requirement can be partially satisfied through use of TLS or QUIC (See <xref target="RFC8446"/> and <xref target="RFC9000"/>)</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="secure-input-and-output-handling"><name>Secure input and output handling</name>

<t>Architectural / Procedural requirements:</t>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-54: Data input validation (ensuring that data is safe prior to use) and output filtering.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="logging"><name>Logging</name>

<t>Architectural / Procedural requirements:</t>

<t>ENISA GP-TM-55: Implement a logging system that records events relating to user authentication, management of accounts and access rights, modifications to security rules, and the functioning of the system. Logs must be preserved on durable storage and retrievable via authenticated connections.</t>

<t>Certain logs can be transported via RATS: See <xref target="I-D.ietf-rats-eat"/>. Where assosciated with SUIT firmware updates, logs can be transported using SUIT Reports. See <xref target="I-D.ietf-suit-report"/>.</t>

   the devices to which it applies, and cryptographic information
   protecting the manifest.  Software updates and Trusted Invocation

   encodes those sequences of operations, rather than declaring the

      <abstract>
	 <t>   Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
   the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide
   whether to engage in secure interactions with it.  Evidence about
   trustworthiness can be rather complex and it is deemed unrealistic
   that every Relying Party is capable of the appraisal of Evidence.
   Therefore that burden is typically offloaded to a Verifier.  In order
   to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier requires not only fresh
   Evidence from an Attester, but also trusted Endorsements and
   Reference Values from Endorsers and Reference Value Providers, such
   as manufacturers, distributors, or device owners.  This document
   specifies Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM) that
   represent Endorsements and Reference Values in CBOR format.
   Composite devices or systems are represented by a collection of
   Concise Module Identifiers (CoMID) and Concise Software Identifiers
   (CoSWID) bundled in a CoRIM document.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   Attestation is the process by which an entity produces evidence about
   itself that another party can use to evaluate the trustworthiness of
   that entity.

   In use cases that require the use of remote attestation, such as
   confidential computing or device onboarding, an attester has to
   convey evidence or attestation results to a relying party.  This
   information exchange may happen at different layers in the protocol
   stack.

   This specification provides a generic way of passing evidence and
   attestation results in the TLS handshake.  Functionality-wise this is
   accomplished with the help of key attestation.
